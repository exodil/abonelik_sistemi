# Audit Report

## Authentication Flow
The authentication process in AboneKaptan mobil relies on Google Sign-In to access Gmail data. The flow is initiated from the UI and managed by `GoogleAuthManager`.

1.  **User Interaction (SignInScreen)**: The user initiates the sign-in process through the `SignInScreen` (`MainActivity.kt`). Clicking the sign-in button triggers `viewModel.startSignIn(signInLauncher)`.

2.  **ViewModel Request (MainViewModel)**:
    *   `MainViewModel.startSignIn()` is called.
    *   It sets `_isSigningIn` to `true` (updates UI to show loading).
    *   It then calls `googleAuthManager.signIn(launcher)`.

3.  **Authentication Manager (GoogleAuthManager)**:
    *   `GoogleAuthManager.signIn()` creates an `Intent` using `googleSignInClient.signInIntent`.
    *   This intent is launched by the `signInLauncher` (an `ActivityResultLauncher` instance managed in `MainActivity.kt`). This prompts the user to select a Google account and grant necessary permissions.
    *   The `GoogleSignInOptions (gso)` are configured in `GoogleAuthManager` to request `email` and the `GmailScopes.GMAIL_READONLY` scope, ensuring read-only access to Gmail.

4.  **Handling Sign-In Result (MainActivity & MainViewModel)**:
    *   The result of the Google Sign-In activity is received by the `signInLauncher` in `MainActivity.kt`.
    *   `viewModel.handleSignInResult(task)` is called with the `Task<GoogleSignInAccount>`.
    *   `MainViewModel.handleSignInResult()`:
        *   Sets `_isSigningIn` to `false`.
        *   Attempts to get the `GoogleSignInAccount` from the task.
        *   If successful:
            *   Calls `googleAuthManager.updateCurrentAccount(account)` to store the signed-in account details.
            *   Sets `_isSignedIn` to `true`.
            *   Initiates data processing by calling `classifyAndRefreshDb()`.
        *   If failed:
            *   Sets `_isSignedIn` to `false`.
            *   Sets an error message in `_error` StateFlow.

5.  **Credential Management (GoogleAuthManager)**:
    *   `GoogleAuthManager` initializes `GoogleSignInOptions` and `GoogleSignInClient` in its constructor.
    *   It attempts to get the last signed-in account using `GoogleSignIn.getLastSignedInAccount(context)`.
    *   The `GoogleAccountCredential` is initialized in `initializeCredential()` using `GoogleAccountCredential.usingOAuth2` with the `GmailScopes.GMAIL_READONLY` scope.
    *   `updateCurrentAccount()` updates the `currentAccount` and sets the `selectedAccount` on the `credential` object. This credential is later used by `GmailRepository` (indirectly via `GmailApi` service construction which requires this credential) to make authenticated API calls to Gmail.
    *   `getCredential()` provides this credential when needed.

6.  **Sign Out (MainViewModel & GoogleAuthManager)**:
    *   `MainViewModel.signOut()` calls `googleAuthManager.signOut()`.
    *   `GoogleAuthManager.signOut()` calls `googleSignInClient.signOut()`.
    *   On successful sign-out, `currentAccount` and `credential.selectedAccount` are cleared in `GoogleAuthManager`, and `_isSignedIn` is set to `false` in `MainViewModel`.

**Relevant Files and Classes:**
*   `MainActivity.kt`: Manages the `ActivityResultLauncher` for sign-in and hosts the UI (`SignInScreen`, `SubscriptionListScreen`).
*   `MainViewModel.kt`: Handles UI logic, initiates sign-in/sign-out, and manages user session state (`isSignedIn`, `isSigningIn`).
*   `GoogleAuthManager.kt`: Core class for managing Google Sign-In, account details, and OAuth2 credentials. It configures scopes and provides the `GoogleAccountCredential` necessary for Gmail API access.
*   `GmailRepository.kt`: (Indirectly) Uses the `GoogleAccountCredential` provided by `GoogleAuthManager` to authorize Gmail API requests for fetching emails. The actual API client setup (likely `GmailApi.kt`, not provided) would be where this credential is directly used.

## Email-Fetch Pipeline
The email fetching process is managed by `MainViewModel` and `GmailRepository`, using the Gmail API.

1.  **Initiation (MainViewModel)**:
    *   After successful sign-in or on manual refresh, `MainViewModel.classifyAndRefreshDb()` is called.
    *   This function sets loading states (`_isLoading`, `_progressMessage`, `_progressPercentage`).
    *   It then calls `gmailRepository.fetchEmails()`.

2.  **Fetching Email List (GmailRepository)**:
    *   `GmailRepository.fetchEmails()` is a suspend function running on `Dispatchers.IO`.
    *   **Query Construction**: It uses a Gmail query string. Currently, a simple query `"in:inbox -in:spam -in:trash"` is used for testing. A more complex commented-out query exists, targeting `trustedSenderDomains` and `positiveKeywords`.
    *   **Pagination**: It fetches email message IDs in batches using `gmailApi.listMessages()`.
        *   `maxResultsPerQuery` (default 50, capped at 100 for API) controls batch size.
        *   `maxTotalEmails` (default 1000) limits the total number of emails fetched.
        *   It uses `nextPageToken` from the API response to get subsequent pages of message IDs.
    *   **Progress Reporting**: It calls the `onProgress` callback (provided by `MainViewModel`) with the current count of fetched emails and the target total.
    *   **Duplicate Prevention**: A `processedMessageIds` set is used to avoid processing the same message ID multiple times if it appears in overlapping API responses (though less likely with standard pagination).

3.  **Fetching Email Details (GmailRepository)**:
    *   For each unique message ID obtained, it asynchronously calls `gmailApi.getMessage(messageRef.id, format = "full")` to get the full details of the email.
    *   These calls are made concurrently using `async` and `awaitAll`.
    *   Error handling is present for individual message detail fetches.

4.  **Parsing Email Details (GmailRepository)**:
    *   `parseGmailMessage()` is called for each successfully fetched `GmailMessage`.
    *   This function extracts key information:
        *   `From`, `To` (multiple recipients handled), `Subject` headers.
        *   `internalDate` (converted to Long).
        *   `id`, `threadId`, `labelIds`.
        *   `snippet` from the API.
    *   **Body Extraction**:
        *   `extractTextParts()` recursively traverses the email's MIME parts (`payload.parts`).
        *   It looks for `text/plain` and `text/html` parts.
        *   The content of these parts is Base64 decoded using `decodeBase64()`.
        *   It returns both plain text and HTML content if available.
    *   An `effectiveBodySnippet` is created using the API's `snippet` if available and non-blank, otherwise, it falls back to the extracted `bodyPlainText` (capped at 250 chars).
    *   A `RawEmail` object is constructed with this information.

5.  **Data Return (GmailRepository -> MainViewModel)**:
    *   `fetchEmails()` returns a `List<RawEmail>` to `MainViewModel`.
    *   `MainViewModel` then prepares these emails (ensuring `bodySnippet` is populated) and passes them to `SubscriptionClassifier.classifyEmails()`.

**Key Parameters & Logic:**
*   `maxResultsPerQuery`: Batch size for listing messages.
*   `maxTotalEmails`: Overall limit on emails to fetch.
*   `trustedSenderDomains`, `positiveKeywords`, `negativeKeywords`: Lists used for constructing more targeted (though currently commented out) queries and potentially for pre-filtering (the `isPotentiallySubscriptionRelated` function exists but is not currently used in the main fetch loop).
*   `decodeBase64()`: Handles URL-safe Base64 decoding for email body content.
*   Error logging is present throughout the process.

**Relevant Files and Classes:**
*   `MainViewModel.kt`: Initiates the email fetching process and handles progress updates for the UI.
*   `GmailRepository.kt`: Contains the core logic for querying the Gmail API, fetching message lists and details, parsing messages into `RawEmail` objects, and handling pagination.
*   `GmailApi.kt` (not provided): Assumed to be the Retrofit or similar interface defining methods like `listMessages()` and `getMessage()`.
*   `RawEmail.kt` (model): Represents the structured data extracted from an email.
*   `GmailMessage.kt`, `MessagePayload.kt` (models): Likely represent the structure of data received from the Gmail API.

## Current Classification Logic
The classification of emails into subscription lifecycle events (new subscriptions, cancellations) is handled by `SubscriptionClassifier`.

1.  **Initiation (MainViewModel)**:
    *   After emails are fetched and prepared, `MainViewModel.classifyAndRefreshDb()` calls `subscriptionClassifier.classifyEmails(rawEmails, onProgress)`.

2.  **Email Processing (SubscriptionClassifier)**:
    *   `classifyEmails()` sorts emails by date (newest first).
    *   It fetches "reliable subscription patterns" from `communityPatternRepo.getReliableSubscriptionPatterns()` for service name determination.
    *   It iterates through each `RawEmail`:
        *   **Content Preparation**: `prepareEmailContentForClassification()` combines the email's subject, sender, and body/snippet into a single string for the AI model.
        *   **AI Classification**: `huggingFaceRepository.classifySubscriptionLifecycle(emailContent)` is called. This function (presumably interacting with a Hugging Face model) returns a classification result, which includes scores for labels like "paid_subscription_event" and "paid_subscription_cancellation".
        *   **Service Name Determination**: `determineServiceName()` is called to identify the service associated with the email.
            *   It first tries to match the email against the pre-fetched `SubscriptionPatternEntity` list using `matchesPattern()`. This function checks email content (from, subject, body based on `PatternType`) against regex patterns in the entities.
            *   If no pattern matches, it falls back to `extractGeneralServiceName()`, which uses heuristics (sender display name, capitalized words in subject, domain name parts) to guess the service name.
        *   **Event Handling**:
            *   Scores for "paid_subscription_event" and "paid_subscription_cancellation" are retrieved from the AI model's output.
            *   A `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (currently 0.75f) is used.
            *   If `paidEventScore` is >= threshold and greater than `cancellationScore`, `handlePaidSubscriptionEvent()` is called.
            *   If `cancellationScore` is >= threshold (and `paidEventScore` condition was not met), `handlePaidSubscriptionCancellation()` is called.
            *   Otherwise, the classification is considered ambiguous or below threshold, and it's logged.

3.  **Database Interaction (SubscriptionClassifier using UserSubscriptionDao)**:
    *   **`handlePaidSubscriptionEvent()`**:
        *   Retrieves the latest existing subscription for the `serviceName` and `userId` (currently null) from `userSubscriptionDao.getLatestSubscriptionByServiceNameAndUserId()`.
        *   **New Subscription**: If no existing subscription, or if the existing one was `CANCELLED` and the current email's date is after the `subscriptionEndDate`, a new `UserSubscriptionEntity` is inserted with `status = STATUS_ACTIVE`, `subscriptionStartDate = email.date`.
        *   **Update Active**: If an `ACTIVE` subscription exists, its `lastActiveConfirmationDate` and `lastEmailIdProcessed` are updated.
    *   **`handlePaidSubscriptionCancellation()`**:
        *   Retrieves the latest existing `ACTIVE` subscription.
        *   If found and the email date is not before `subscriptionStartDate`:
            *   Updates the entity's `status` to `STATUS_CANCELLED`.
            *   Sets `subscriptionEndDate` to `email.date`.
            *   Updates `lastEmailIdProcessed`.
    *   All database operations (insert/update) are performed via `userSubscriptionDao`.

4.  **Progress Reporting**:
    *   `classifyEmails()` calls the `onProgress` callback (provided by `MainViewModel`) with the count of processed emails and the total to process.

**Models and Heuristics:**
*   **AI Model**: An unspecified Hugging Face model (via `HuggingFaceRepository`) is used for primary lifecycle classification (paid event vs. cancellation). The specific model architecture or fine-tuning details are not available in the provided code.
*   **Regex Patterns**: `SubscriptionPatternEntity` objects contain `regexPattern` and `PatternType` which are used by `matchesPattern()` for service name identification. These patterns are sourced from `CommunityPatternRepository`.
*   **Heuristics for Service Name**: `extractGeneralServiceName()` uses string manipulation (sender name, subject keywords, domain parsing) as a fallback for service name identification. This includes avoiding common domains (e.g., "gmail.com", "support") and capitalizing words.
*   **Keywords**: `GmailRepository` contains `positiveKeywords` and `negativeKeywords` lists, but these are currently used in a commented-out query and not directly in the classification logic of `SubscriptionClassifier`.

**Relevant Files and Classes:**
*   `SubscriptionClassifier.kt`: Core class for the classification logic, orchestrating AI calls, service name determination, and database updates.
*   `MainViewModel.kt`: Initiates classification and receives progress updates.
*   `HuggingFaceRepository.kt` (interface/implementation not fully shown): Interacts with the AI model.
*   `UserSubscriptionDao.kt` (interface/implementation not fully shown): Data Access Object for `UserSubscriptionEntity`.
*   `UserSubscriptionEntity.kt` (model): Represents a subscription record in the local database.
*   `CommunityPatternRepository.kt` (interface/implementation not fully shown): Provides regex patterns for service name identification.
*   `SubscriptionPatternEntity.kt` (model): Represents a regex pattern for identifying a service.
*   `RawEmail.kt` (model): The input data for classification.

## Major Modules (Inputs/Outputs, Heuristics/Models)

This section summarizes the major components of the AboneKaptan mobile application, their primary responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and any significant heuristics or models they employ.

1.  **`GoogleAuthManager.kt`**
    *   **Responsibility**: Handles Google Sign-In and OAuth2 credential management for Gmail API access.
    *   **Inputs**: User interaction (sign-in intent), Application Context.
    *   **Outputs**: `GoogleSignInAccount`, `GoogleAccountCredential` (for Gmail API).
    *   **Heuristics/Models**: None directly, but configures Google Sign-In options and scopes (requests `GmailScopes.GMAIL_READONLY`).

2.  **`GmailRepository.kt`**
    *   **Responsibility**: Fetches and parses emails from the Gmail API.
    *   **Inputs**: `GmailApi` service (for API calls), query parameters (currently simple, potentially complex keyword/domain-based), pagination controls (`maxResultsPerQuery`, `maxTotalEmails`).
    *   **Outputs**: `List<RawEmail>`.
    *   **Heuristics/Models**:
        *   MIME part traversal (`extractTextParts`) to get plain and HTML body.
        *   Base64 decoding for email content.
        *   Uses `trustedSenderDomains`, `positiveKeywords`, `negativeKeywords` (currently for a commented-out query, but available for filtering logic).
        *   `parseGmailMessage` logic to structure email data into `RawEmail`.

3.  **`SubscriptionClassifier.kt`**
    *   **Responsibility**: Classifies emails to identify subscription lifecycle events (new, cancelled) and updates the local database.
    *   **Inputs**: `List<RawEmail>`, `CommunityPatternRepository` (for service name patterns), `HuggingFaceRepository` (for AI classification), `UserSubscriptionDao` (for DB access).
    *   **Outputs**: Writes/updates `UserSubscriptionEntity` records in the database. No direct return value from `classifyEmails` method, but triggers UI updates indirectly via DB changes.
    *   **Heuristics/Models**:
        *   **AI Model (via `HuggingFaceRepository`)**: Primary model for classifying email content as "paid_subscription_event" or "paid_subscription_cancellation". Operates on combined subject, sender, and snippet. Relies on `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`.
        *   **Service Name Determination (`determineServiceName`)**:
            *   Uses `SubscriptionPatternEntity` (regex and type) from `CommunityPatternRepository` as the primary method.
            *   Fallback to `extractGeneralServiceName`: Heuristics based on sender display name, capitalized subject words, and domain name parsing. Includes logic to avoid common non-service words/domains and a `capitalizeWords` utility.
        *   **Database Logic**: `handlePaidSubscriptionEvent` and `handlePaidSubscriptionCancellation` contain logic for inserting new subscriptions or updating existing ones (e.g., status, dates) based on classification results and existing DB state.

4.  **`MainViewModel.kt`**
    *   **Responsibility**: Acts as the central orchestrator for the UI and business logic. Manages UI state, initiates authentication, email fetching, classification, and data loading for display.
    *   **Inputs**: User actions (from UI like `MainActivity`), `GoogleAuthManager`, `GmailRepository`, `SubscriptionClassifier`, `UserSubscriptionDao`, `FeedbackRepository`.
    *   **Outputs**: UI state as `StateFlow`s (`isSignedIn`, `isLoading`, `subscriptions`, `error`, `progressPercentage`, `progressMessage`). Triggers actions in other modules.
    *   **Heuristics/Models**:
        *   Manages the overall workflow: Sign-In -> Fetch Emails -> Classify Emails -> Load Subscriptions from DB -> Update UI.
        *   `mapEntitiesToSubscriptionItems`: Transforms `UserSubscriptionEntity` from DB to `SubscriptionItem` for UI display, including status mapping.
        *   Progress reporting logic during multi-step operations.

5.  **`MainActivity.kt`**
    *   **Responsibility**: Main entry point for the Android application. Hosts Jetpack Compose UI, manages the `ActivityResultLauncher` for Google Sign-In.
    *   **Inputs**: User interactions, `MainViewModel` (for UI state and actions).
    *   **Outputs**: Renders UI screens (`SignInScreen`, `SubscriptionListScreen`) based on ViewModel state.
    *   **Heuristics/Models**: None directly; primarily UI and lifecycle management.

6.  **Local Database (via `UserSubscriptionDao` and `FeedbackDao`)**
    *   **Responsibility**: Persists user subscription data (`UserSubscriptionEntity`) and user feedback (`FeedbackEntity`).
    *   **Inputs**: `UserSubscriptionEntity` objects (from `SubscriptionClassifier`), `FeedbackEntity` objects (from `MainViewModel`).
    *   **Outputs**: `List<UserSubscriptionEntity>` (to `MainViewModel` for display).
    *   **Heuristics/Models**: Database schema (`UserSubscriptionEntity` structure) defines how subscription data is stored (service name, start/end dates, status, etc.).

**Data Flow Summary:**
User authenticates via `GoogleAuthManager` -> `MainViewModel` initiates email fetching via `GmailRepository` -> `GmailRepository` fetches and parses emails into `RawEmail` objects -> `MainViewModel` passes `RawEmail` list to `SubscriptionClassifier` -> `SubscriptionClassifier` uses `HuggingFaceRepository` (AI) and `CommunityPatternRepository` (regex/heuristics) to determine service name and lifecycle event -> `SubscriptionClassifier` writes/updates `UserSubscriptionEntity` in the local DB via `UserSubscriptionDao` -> `MainViewModel` reads `UserSubscriptionEntity` list from `UserSubscriptionDao`, maps them to `SubscriptionItem` objects, and updates the UI.

## Improve Subscription-Detection Accuracy

This section outlines potential areas for enhancing the accuracy of subscription detection within the application.

### Recommendations for `SubscriptionClassifier.kt` Enhancements

The following are potential enhancements for the actual `SubscriptionClassifier.kt` to improve its accuracy and robustness:

1.  **Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   The global `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (currently 0.75f) for the Hugging Face model's predictions could be made more flexible. If the model exhibits varying reliability for "paid_subscription_event" versus "paid_subscription_cancellation" labels, consider implementing category-specific thresholds.
    *   Emails classified with lower confidence (e.g., just below the threshold) shouldn't necessarily be discarded. They could be flagged for "user review" or passed to a secondary processing stage that applies a more stringent set of heuristic rules or keyword checks.

2.  **Fallback Rules for Ambiguous Cases:**
    *   When an email yields moderate confidence scores for conflicting labels (e.g., "paid_subscription_event" at 0.6 and "paid_subscription_cancellation" at 0.55), the classifier could trigger a set of fallback rules.
    *   These rules could involve more targeted keyword analysis within the email body/subject (e.g., searching for phrases like "welcome to your subscription," "your account is now active" versus "your subscription has ended," "we're sorry to see you go," "cancellation confirmation").
    *   Additionally, the system could check the recency and status of any prior known subscriptions for the identified service to provide context. For instance, a "cancellation-like" email for a service that was never active would be suspect.

3.  **Robustly Flagging Ongoing and Recently Canceled Subscriptions:**
    *   **Re-subscription Logic**: The existing `handlePaidSubscriptionEvent` could be enhanced. If a "paid_subscription_event" is detected for a service that was marked `STATUS_CANCELLED` very recently (e.g., within the last few days or a typical billing cycle), the system could either:
        *   Automatically reactivate the subscription.
        *   Flag it as a potential re-subscription and prompt the user for confirmation, especially if the new event email is ambiguous.
    *   **Handling Cancellation of Recently Started Subscriptions**: Conversely, if a "paid_subscription_cancellation" email appears very shortly after a "paid_subscription_event" for the same service, this could be flagged as unusual, potentially indicating a trial cancellation or an error.
    *   **Leveraging `lastActiveConfirmationDate`**: While `SubscriptionClassifier` primarily focuses on new events, the `lastActiveConfirmationDate` in `UserSubscriptionEntity` is crucial for managing ongoing status. Periodic checks or logic could use this date to infer if an `ACTIVE` subscription is still truly ongoing if no new "paid_subscription_event" emails are received for an extended period (e.g., longer than the typical billing cycle for that service, if known). This is more about state management post-classification but informs the overall accuracy of the subscription list.

## How to Run the Updated Pipeline Locally

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Open the project in Android Studio.**
3.  **Connect an Android device or start an emulator.** Ensure the device/emulator has Google Play Services installed and is configured with a Google account.
4.  **Build and run the 'app' configuration.** This will install the application on the selected device/emulator.
5.  **Sign in with a Google account** when prompted by the application. This will initiate the email fetching and classification process. The progress, including estimated time remaining, will be displayed on the screen.

## How to Evaluate Subscription-Detection Performance (Simulated)

The current version uses a simulated approach to evaluate subscription detection performance due to the inability to run the live Hugging Face model in this development environment.

*   **Test Data**: Sample email data is defined in `app/src/test/java/com/example/abonekaptanmobile/data/SubscriptionTestData.kt` within the `sampleTestEmails` list. This list contains various scenarios, including clear subscription events, cancellations, and ambiguous or irrelevant emails.
*   **Test Helper**: The core simulation and evaluation logic resides in `app/src/test/java/com/example/abonekaptanmobile/services/SubscriptionClassifierTestHelper.kt`.
    *   The `runClassificationTest` method in this helper class currently uses *dummy logic* to assign `detectedLabel` and `detectedService` to the test emails, rather than invoking the actual `SubscriptionClassifier`'s AI model. This dummy logic has been intentionally modified to show "baseline" and "improved" scenarios.
    *   The `evaluateResults` method calculates precision, recall, and F1-scores based on the comparison between `expectedLabel` from `SubscriptionTestData.kt` and the `detectedLabel` from the dummy logic.
*   **Test Classes**:
    *   `SubscriptionClassifierBaselineTest.kt` (located in `app/src/test/java/com/example/abonekaptanmobile/services/`) establishes baseline performance metrics using the initial dummy classification logic.
    *   `SubscriptionClassifierImprovedTest.kt` (in the same directory) demonstrates improved metrics after applying targeted "fixes" to the dummy classification logic for specific test emails.

### Instructions for Running the Simulated Evaluation:

1.  **Open the project in Android Studio.**
2.  **Navigate to the test files**:
    *   For baseline metrics: `app/src/test/java/com/example/abonekaptanmobile/services/SubscriptionClassifierBaselineTest.kt`
    *   For "improved" metrics: `app/src/test/java/com/example/abonekaptanmobile/services/SubscriptionClassifierImprovedTest.kt`
3.  **Run the tests**: Right-click on the class name (e.g., `SubscriptionClassifierBaselineTest`) or a specific test method within the file (e.g., `testCalculateBaselineMetrics()`) and select "Run '<TestName>'".
4.  **View results**: The simulated precision/recall/F1 metrics for "paid_subscription_event", "paid_subscription_cancellation", and "other" categories will be printed to the console in the test results panel (usually under the "Run" tab in Android Studio).

### Note on Adapting for a Live Classifier:

To evaluate a live classifier (once the Hugging Face model is integrated and runnable):

*   The `runClassificationTest` method within `SubscriptionClassifierTestHelper.kt` would need significant modification.
*   Instead of its current dummy logic, it would need to:
    1.  Accept an actual instance of `SubscriptionClassifier`.
    2.  Iterate through the `TestEmail` data from `SubscriptionTestData.kt`.
    3.  For each `TestEmail`, convert it into a `RawEmail` object (or a format compatible with `SubscriptionClassifier`).
    4.  Invoke the actual `SubscriptionClassifier.classifyEmails()` method (or a similar method that processes a single email for testing). This, in turn, would call the live Hugging Face model.
    5.  The `ClassifiedResult` would be derived from the classifier's actual output (i.e., the label assigned by the AI model and the service name determined by the classifier).
*   The `evaluateResults` method would then calculate real performance metrics based on these live results.
*   This would require the testing environment to have access to the Hugging Face model and any necessary APIs if the model is hosted.
